# Simple ERC-681 Link Generator
A very simple page built with Vite and React that allows you to generate ERC-681 links to request payments through Ethereum-compatible networks.

Your wallet must be compatible with ERC-681 links for someone to use the QR code generated by this page; I've only tested with the [Base App](https://base.app).

# Usage
Open the page and start by pasting in the wallet address that will receive the funds. This page features a very simple implementation of `wagmi` that will allow you to autofill your wallet address if your browser has a built-in wallet (such as Brave or a mobile wallet's browser), or if a wallet extension exists in your browser.

There is a list of well known token-chain pairs available, and a list of known chain IDs available if using a custom token.

# Where to use
